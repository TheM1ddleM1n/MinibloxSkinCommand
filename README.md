# MinibloxSkinConsoleCommand

Console-based skin changer for Miniblox. Use responsibly and only on your own account.

## ⚠️ Important WARNINGS

- **NEVER share your token with anyone** - it gives full access to your account.
- **Use only on your own account** - using this on other accounts is against ToS.
- **Use at your own risk** - this is an unofficial tool.
- Your token is sensitive - treat it like your password.

## Usage

### Step 1: Get Your Token!

1. Open Miniblox in your browser
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Console
3. Paste the contents of `token.js` and press Enter
4. Copy the token that appears (keep it safe!)

### Step 2: Apply Your Skin!

1. Open `skin.js` in a text editor
2. Replace `"your_token_goes_here"` with your actual token
3. (Optional) Change `SKIN_ID` to the skin you want (default: "remlin")
4. Paste the modified code into the console and press Enter
5. Refresh the page to see your new skin!

## 📝 The Available Skin IDs

You can change one of the 9 `SKIN_ID` variables to any of these:
- `"remlin"`
- `"cat"`
- `"ethan"`
- `"sushi"`
- `"slime"`
- `"duck"`
- `"tester"`
- `"banana"`
- `"qhyun"`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting!

**"No session token found"**
- Make sure you're logged into Miniblox first
- Try refreshing the page and running token.js again

**"Token not set"**
- You forgot to replace `"your_token_goes_here"` with your actual token
- Copy the token from Step 1 and paste it properly

**"HTTP Error" or fetch fails**
- Check your internet connection
- The server might be down - try again later
- Your token might have expired - get a new one with token.js

**Skin doesn't appear**
- Refresh the page after running skin.js
- The skin ID might be invalid - try a different one
